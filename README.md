### Result ATM *27/03/2017* (no bayesian yet)

  * 1 MTC and 3 Greedy (MTC thinking they are all Greedy): 15.491 average step
  * 4 Greedy: 10.965 average step
  * 4 Teammate aware: 8.708 average step
  * 1 MTC and 3 Teammate aware (MTC thinking they are all Teammates): 15 average step
  
### Result  *30/04/2017* (no tree saving between iteration)

  * 1 MTC and 3 Greedy : 15.62 average step (1000 simulations in around 8 minutes)
  * 1 MTC and 3 Teammate aware : 14.724 average step (1000 simulation in around 8 minutes)
  * 1 MTC 1 Greedy and 2 Teammate aware : 26.151 average step (1000 simulation in around 12 minutes)
  * 1 MTC 2 Greedy and 1 Teammate aware : 25.279 average step (1000 simulation in around 10 minutes)

### Result  *01/05/2017* (no tree saving between iteration BUT this time the prey doesn't have the mouvement priority anymore, (order priority chosen randomly every iteration))

  * 4 greedy: 9.166 average step
  * 4 Teammate aware: 5.483 average step
  * 1 MTC and 3 Greedy :11.017 average step (1000 simulations in around 10 minutes)
  * 1 MTC and 3 Teammate aware : 9.505 average step (1000 simulation in around 8 minutes)
  * 1 MTC 1 Greedy and 2 Teammate aware : xxx average step (1000 simulation in around x minutes)
  * 1 MTC 2 Greedy and 1 Teammate aware : xxx average step (1000 simulation in around x minutes)
